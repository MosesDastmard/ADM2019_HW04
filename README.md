Goals of this assignment are: 
1. Bloom filter using hashing to make faster the procedure of checking an element is already exit in a set.
2. Alphabetical sorting using counting sort as it's core.
3. Implementing K-means
4. Drawback of K-means when it takes too much time

 
The repository includes the following files:
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
     > A Jupyter notebook which provides an overview of every single step of which the process to implement the code has                     consisted in.
			
2. __`hashing_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file which contains the code about hashing and bloom filter and finding the true false positives. 

3. __`sorting_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file which has all the functions needed for alphabetical sorting and analysing empirical running time. 
      
4. __`clustring_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file containing the code needed to implement K-means on given data.
      
5. __`theoretical_lib.py`__:
      > A Python file with all are needed to check the K-means cons and the posibility of trapping in local minimum.
